	<ResearchProject_RTEmergencyPower.description>Allows reconfiguring a power switch to automatically turn on if an adjacent power network is about to run out of power, and turn off again when the network's batteries are fully charged.

This behavior is not instant, however, so it's advisable to have at least one battery on every network joined by the switch.
