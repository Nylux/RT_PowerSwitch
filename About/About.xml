	<description>Adds a new researchable (RT Mods research tab) function to the power switch: when enabled, the switch will automatically turn on when an adjacent powernet is about to run out of power, and turn off once the batteries are all full.

Available languages:
 - Chinese (simplified) (by duduluu)
 - Chinese (traditional) (by duduluu)
 - English
 - Russian
 - Spanish (Castilian) (by a kind stranger who wished to remain anonymous)
 - Spanish (Latin America) (by a kind stranger who wished to remain anonymous)
